### As a user, I want to:

    - Click a button and begin the game.
    - See how much money I am starting with in my bank.
    - Click a button and bet in whole dollar amounts.
    - Be stopped if I have not bet before my hand is dealt.
    - Click a button and my hand is dealt.
    - Once dealt, clearly see my cards and the dealer's one face-up card.
    - Choose to "hit" or "stand" based on my cards.
    - Be informed if I have won the hand or not.
    - Be informed of how much money is left in my bank.
    - Be able to bet again and be dealt cards again.
    - Once the dealer or myself is out of money, be informed that I have won the pot or not.
    - Be able to fully start the game over and play again.
